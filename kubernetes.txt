node
----
kube proxy -----> kubelt -----> pods


etcd --- to manage the state master to master and worker  nodes
api ----- used to REST command entry point to cluster 
key value store --- resulting the state of cluster store the distributed key value store 
controler --- control manager to worker traffice 
               life cycle function create namespace, event garbage collection,node garbage collection
               detremine the states in cluster 

sheduler -------  regulate the slave on nodes , store the usage information of each slave nodes
                   shedule the work from pod and services

kublet ----- Its a agent communicate with master and execute the nodes or worker nodes
         ---- get the information from api-server the ensure containers are Up and running.

pod --- It a one or group of container shared storage/network specification of run the container 
        same content and IP shared one pod to another via localhost

kube-proxy --- Its run on each  node deal with  individual host subnetting and ensure that services are availabe on external parties
                act as a load balance for single worker node
